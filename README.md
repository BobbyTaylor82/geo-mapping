# geo-mapping

The United States Geological Survey provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. So, I decided to visualize this data on a geo-map using leaflet. This is the [GeoJSON endpoint](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) I used for this project. This endpoint provides information for all earthquakes in the past week. 

You can explore this interactive map at this [link](https://bobbytaylor82.github.io/geo-mapping/).
